					Wine Enthusiast Magazine asked us to build their first-ever Augmented Reality magazine cover. The task was to create an application that would launch a digital experience when the magazine cover was detected. In collaboration with the magazine and award-winning digital artist Pete Bollinger, we elected to choose a sci-fi interface that brought Peterâ€™s video to life by creating a 3D version of it that is displayed in different layers as if they were coming right out of the magazine. The experience ends with a very futuristic hologram of the actual cover. Check out the full Wine Enthusiast article <a href="http://www.enth.to/2JZNeBU" target="_blank">here</a>
